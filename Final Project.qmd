### Sources links

https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/7624538?sommaire=7624746&utm_

With this link, we downloaded :

- P3D – Indicateurs généraux de la population par département et région - Séries depuis 1990;
- P1D – Évolution générale de la situation démographique par département et région - Séries depuis 1990
- P2D – Mortalité infantile par département et région - Séries depuis 1990.

On the Data DREES website: https://data.drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/explore/dataset/la-demographie-des-professionnels-de-sante-depuis-2012/information/

We downloaded data on midwife demographics from 2012 to 2025.

Then, we moved them to csv files only keeping the year 2019, the last year available before COVID, which might affect the result.

### Description of the sources

The data comes from French sources, the INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) and the DREES (Directorate for Research, Studies, Evaluation, and Statistics).

Infant Mortality provides department-level statistics on the number of deaths of children under one year old. These data, produced by INSEE and Santé publique France, help analyze regional disparities in infant health.

Population Indicators include information on fertility, average maternal age at childbirth, and the proportion of births outside marriage, broken down by department and year.

Demographic Situation contains data on marriages, population counts, nuptiality rates, birth rates, and natural population growth by department and year. 

Midwives RPPS 2012–2025 tracks the number and density of registered midwives across French departments.

### Research Question

#### Why does infant mortality vary so much across French departments?

This project examines the factors that can explain variations in infant mortality rates across French departments. We will look at the role of demographic characteristics and access to maternal healthcare. While France performs relatively well in terms of infant health at the national level, there are huge territorial disparities. Some departments consistently have higher infant mortality rates than others, raising questions about the causes of these differences.

Demographic indicators such as fertility rates, maternal age at childbirth, and the proportion of births outside marriage—offer explains the social and economic contexts in which children are born. These factors may influence early childhood health risks.

A key aspect of this research is the distribution of midwives across departments. Midwives play a important role in premature deaths. 

The project aims to identify the factors most closely associated with variations in infant mortality. The objective is not only to describe regional disparities but also to understand their causes. 

We only kept data from 2019, the most recent year available before covid that could influence our results.
